## What does it do?
It converts IPython Notebooks from Python2 to Python3. 
Basically, it is simply calling 2to3 on the code cells of a Notebook.


## How to use?
* 2to3_ipynb in.ipyn out.ipynb


#### TODO
* test on Linux (and Mac)
* test with IPython 3 Notebooks -> seems to be mostly working
* errors with magic lines
